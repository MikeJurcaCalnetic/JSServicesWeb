       overview: `A market in a NEUTRAL DIGESTION signature state is in a sideways environment with choppy trading conditions. In this market state directional moves are not expected to be sustained. Opportunity exists on both sides of the market, albeit profit potential is limited and should be realized “sooner than later”. Markets that do end a session with a strong directional bias will have trouble sustaining that bias in the coming session, without the support of a positive shift in the next session’s market state.NEUTRAL DIGESTIVE sessions can be the precursor to a “BREAKOUT” as the coiling action will build power. Typically a sign that the sentiment is going to change from NEUTRAL DIGESTION to TREND is signaled by an early session trend move with no break in the positive or negative structure. A simple Moving Average is a great tool to use to identify a possible “Breakout” day with the expectation that if the market is going to scale up or down it will maintain a trade above or below the Moving Average.`,

Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY R FADE</span> and <span class="red">SELL R BREAKOUT</span> strategy to capture a price move away from the DIR R LEVEL area. The CR+ and CR- must be breached to validate the respective strategies. If not the likelihood of a Non Event sideways session is high. The MKT is more vulnerable to the downside as this will be a counter to the underlying state signal. Trading below the DP confirms a break in market structure. Counter signals can have a lot of energy. Use a <span class="red">SELL DP BREAKOUT</span> to add to any sales or create a new short position. Expectation is for the MKT to maintain negative structure after the DP failure. If not anticipate a bounce back into a digestive trade. A NEUTRAL POSITIVE SHIFT signal is typically more of a probe higher to see if new interest will enter the MKT and support it. If not, it’s back to the same soft sideways routine. Work any positive momentum generated from a <span class="blue bold">BUY R FADE</span>. If the positive shift is real price action will breach the UP and maintain positive price structure. Use a <span class="red">SELL UP REVERSAL</span> to capture a failure of this signal, anticipating a drop back into a sideways digest down to the DIR R LEVEL. A held trade above the UP or below the DP is the “tell” to an impending trend move. 
       
       Note: The market will be a little indecisive with the potential for a dramatic drop in volatility and a tight digestive session. This is not a technical state to press it but one where patience pays. A held trade above the UP or below the DP is the “tell” to an impending trend move. `,

       overview: `The market has produced a positive signal against underlying negative momentum. The sentiment bias R LEVEL at the upper CriticalRange extreme UP (UPSIDE PIVOT) is an indication that the positive signal is suspect and is expected to “exhaust” at the UP R LEVEL. This UP R LEVEL represents a “hard” lid to the corrective signal. If the market is indeed going to revert to a soft sideways trade it will reject here. Use a <span class="red">SELL R FADE</span> to capture this opportunity. How the MKT reacts at the DIR after a UP rejection is key. If it stabilizes, the likely outlook is a sideways trade within the UP R LEVEL–DIR range. A failure from the DIR can produce an emotional counter signal opportunity. Use a <span class="red">SELL DIR BREAKOUT</span> to capture a negative rotation down to the DP and CRX-. Initiate sales sooner than later on any negative momentum shift as the NEUTRAL nature of the trade state will limit any extended trend move. Don’t press it. No follow through is expected. Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span> to capture a bounce back into a digestive trade. A breakout above the UP R LEVEL however will confirm the positive signal and is expected to provide a “pop” into a higher trade and a quick test of the UT1 (UPSIDE TARGET #1) minimum target. Don’t fight positive structure above the UP R LEVEL as it does have the potential to be the start of a transitional trade north. <span class="red">SELL R FADE</span> opportunities are a better opportunity than a REVERSAL as this level is expected to maintain its integrity if prices are going to reject.

Immediately after the new low print in this scenario the MKT produces a sharp “V” bottom triggering a <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span>.

Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY R FADE</span> and <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span> strategies to <span class="blue bold">BUY</span> off this support base with the expectation that the positive reaction has the potential to remove the corrective threat and engage the BULL TREND.

A <span class="blue bold">BUY DIR BREAKOUT</span> strategy can be used to capture a new price advance with the expectation for a breakout above the UP. Protect profits at the UP as it defines the high point for any <span class="blue bold">BUY</span>ing if the corrective nature of the STATE is going to persist. The <span class="red">SELL UP FADE</span> strategy will work best when any positive impulse rejects “in front” of the UP within the VAR-AD metric. This fact demonstrates weakness. A press through the UP into the upper market metrics is a sign of strength limiting any negative reaction to the DIR. A breakout above the UP does have the potential to fully engage the BULL TREND. Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY UP BREAKOUT</span> strategy to capture a new advance but keep leverage light and risk less, go for more. The MKT should continue to hold a positive trend, so work structure until its broken. A MKT that rejects in front of the UP especially early in the session can be leveraged with a <span class="red">SELL DIR BREAKOUT</span> using an aggressive trail stop, as corrective trades can quickly “reverse” positive. The likely outcome is for the MKT to stabilize in front of the DP R LEVEL range and bounce back into a sideways digest. A breakout below the R LEVEL should provide some emotion on the initial signal if the “corrective” trade is going to extend. If not, more of a “probe” lower will be the expectation with the market settling into a sideways trade.

The DP R LEVEL defines the structure low point for the underlying BULL TREND.  Trading above here shrugs off the corrective signal and keeps the market in a firm posture.

Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY R FADE</span> and <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span> strategies to <span class="blue bold">BUY</span> off this support base with the expectation that the positive reaction has the potential to remove the corrective threat and engage the BULL TREND. A <span class="blue bold">BUY DIR BREAKOUT</span> strategy can be used to add leverage to a positive bounce off the DP R LEVEL. Expectation will be for the MKT to maintain positive price structure and BREAKOUT above the UP. Protect profits at the UP as it defines the high point for any <span class="blue bold">BUY</span>ing if the corrective nature of the STATE is going to persist. The <span class="red">SELL UP FADE</span> strategy will work best when any positive impulse rejects “in front” of the UP within the VAR-AD metric. This shows weakness. A press through the UP into the upper metrics is a sign of strength limiting any negative reaction to the DIR. A breakout above the UP does have the potential to fully engage the BULL TREND. Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY UP BREAKOUT</span> strategy to capture a new advance. The MKT should continue to hold a positive trend, so work structure until its broken. A MKT that rejects in front of the UP especially early in the session can be leveraged with a <span class="red">SELL DIR BREAKOUT</span> using an aggressive trail stop, as corrective trades can quickly “reverse” positive. A <span class="red">SELL R BREAKOUT</span> is needed to confirm the corrective signal and should be “clean” if the MKT is truly breaking structure and transitioning into a Hedge Theme. The “tell” is the MKT holding negative price structure. Risk less and go for more. A 2 APMD move should be the “normal” trade vision.  Any stop and go action following a DP R LEVEL BREAKOUT is a “tell” that the trade will turn digestive.

A false R BREAKOUT is a more digestive than negative signal, unless a <span class="red">SELL UP REVERSAL</span> is triggered. The <span class="red">SELL UP REVERSAL</span> is in alignment with the sentiment bias and has the potential to be the start of the negative transition however it is more likely to stabilize off the DIR.

The <span class="blue bold">BUY DIR CR BREAKOUT</span> is a good strategy for the state to persist expectation as well as a hedge for a <span class="red">SELL UP REVERSAL</span>. The trade vision is for the MKT to bounce and maintain a positive outlook although limited in the current session to the R LEVEL. A break under the DIR either after a <span class="red">SELL UP REVERSAL</span> or on its own is negative, signaling the potential for a state transition. Use the <span class="red">SELL DIR BREAKOUT</span> to get a jump on any negative shift. The key to the success of this strategy is the markets ability to hold negative price structure or not. If so and the trade validates below the CR- it can be pressed anticipating a 2 APMD move down to the DT1 (DOWNSIDE TARGET #1). If the trade is more stop and go after a <span class="red">SELL DIR BREAKOUT</span>, then it is more likely to stabilize off the DP and fall into a sideways digestive mess.

The R LEVEL defines the breaking point for the positive trend. With the R LEVEL equal to the DT1 it creates a support band with the DP (DOWNSIDE PIVOT). The DP – DT1 price “zone” is expected to support any negative price action in the period. Positive reversal signals within this zone are optimal with the bulk of the leverage executed near the R LEVEL. Use the <span class="blue bold">BUY R FADE</span> and <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span> in conjunction to capture this opportunity. Typically a press into this support area early in the trading period will produce the best results followed by an all day, one way advance. Typically the MKT will identify one as the focal point for a positive turn. If the market does trade lower the “tell” that the <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span> will be the new base is price action stabilizing above the CRX-. A failure from the CRX- and a probe lower down to the R LEVEL should be anticipated with the potential for some base building before a new advance begins. A failure from the R LEVEL will signal a break in structure. If the market is going to transition lower it should not trade back above the DP. If so, the downside violation should be considered a “head fake” and the beginning of a new positive leg higher a real possibility. With the <span class="blue bold">BUY</span>ing energy below the market a good strategy is the <span class="red">SELL UP REVERSAL</span> especially early in the trading session. Ideally there is an emotional surge higher early in the session that produces a false UP BREAKOUT triggering the <span class="red">SELL UP REVERSAL</span>. This signal targets the R LEVEL and should incorporate the <span class="red">SELL DIR BREAKOUT</span> to add leverage to any short position.
       
       Note: A positive BREAKOUT above the UP in this state is a valid opportunity however the market may not have enough energy to produce a strong “pop” with more of a gradual trend higher for any positive follow through. Early session strength is questionable based on the current structure bias so be ready to reverse for a corrective break. Use the DIR as the litmus test for the underlying positive tone.

       overview: `A BULL TREND ACCELERATION market state is typified by acceleration in price appreciation. A MKT in this state has produced a major positive technical signal which will follow through immediately if valid. Positive MKT structure is expected to “steepen” with negative “pull-backs” shortening both in size and duration. The KEY “tell” for the follow through potential of the signal is the MKT holding positive structure. Many technical systems have produced positive signals and the MKT should just “go”. If not the prior periods move may be “it” for the positive excitement with a break in structure signaling digestive trading conditions. In addition MKTs can move into a UPA state after a counter trend “squeeze” with the positive signal a 1-day “short squeeze” event producing a counter signal <span class="red">SELL</span> off that gives back the prior periods gains. These signature states are prone to counter signal negative sessions but can be the start of a new 5-8 session advance.`,

       overview: `Technically the MKT is in a BULL TREND ACCELERATION posture and has produced a big positive signal. The MKT should "run" to a new level if the signal is valid. Don’t fight an early break in momentum near resistance as the R LEVEL is below the MKT and a counter signal trade down to this support is a real possibility. Use the <span class="blue bold">BUY R FADE</span> and <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span> together to capture any corrective opportunity. Key off the DIR for the “tell”. If the MKT opens above this level it should stay above it and go. Trading below the DIR can set up a break to <span class="blue bold">BUY</span>. A typical scenario is for the MKT to produce a UP BREAKOUT early in the session that fails and turns the trade negative for the balance of the session down to the DP or R LEVEL. This can be captured with a <span class="red">SELL UP REVERSAL</span> and leverage added with a <span class="red">SELL DIR BREAKOUT</span>. Work negative price structure. If the market turns it can happen quick and be relentless. Have resting orders below the market at PriceMap target levels “in front” of the R LEVEL anticipating a bounce back on the bid. Once the negative structure is broken so too is the lower expectation with the likely result a difficult sideways trading environment. 
       
       Note: The worst-case scenario for a MKT in this technical position is to go higher early in the session and then break all day. Be alert and recognize this.

A MKT in this state has produced a major negative technical signal which will follow through immediately if valid. Negative MKT structure is expected to “accelerate” with positive reactions shortening both in size and duration. The KEY “tell” for the follow through potential of the signal is the MKT holding negative structure. Many technical systems have produced negative signals and the MKT should just “release”. If not the prior periods move may be “it” for the negative emotion with a break in structure signaling a shift into digestive trading conditions. In addition MKTs can move into a DNA state after a sharp counter trend move, with the negative signal a 1-day “squeeze” event producing a counter signal rally that takes back the prior periods losses.

The R LEVEL at the DIR (DIRECTIONAL) is an aggressive position for this Market State representing a “zero tolerance” for any break in negative structure. Typically the DIR R LEVEL is the high point for the next break or the trigger, on a positive breakout, for a counter signal session. Opportunity is focused on the DIR R LEVEL and exists on both sides of the MKT with the likelihood to the downside below the DIR R LEVEL.

As long as the market continues to hold structure, further losses should be expected. This does not mean there cannot be corrective “pull-backs” but rather any positive price action is expected to exhaust below the high inflection point that will maintain structure. Any violation of this resistance point or “break” in the negative structure is more likely to produce a NEUTRAL shift rather than a POSITIVE TRANSITION.

Avoid overleveraging with this or a <span class="red">SELL DP BREAKOUT</span> as the optimal <span class="red">SELL</span> entry is at or near the UP R LEVEL.

Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span> to capture a bounce back into the CriticalRange.

This opportunity can be captured with a <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span>. If the MKT is going to bounce back into a digestive trade it will do so quickly, stabilizing above the DP after a quick exhaustive reversal. A sustained trade below the DP is a sign of weakness that has the MKT vulnerable to a new leg lower. Use the <span class="red">SELL DP BREAKOUT</span> to anticipate a new trend move lower. The “tell” that the trade has some potential is negative trending price action. Without negative price structure the likelihood of a return to a sideways trade is high.

The bulk of any short position should be exited at the 1st break in the negative momentum as the potential for a “V” bounce reversal is high. Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span> to capture this type of opportunity. The DIR R LEVEL will provide a key “tell” to the markets intentions after a positive reversal event at or below the DP. If the momentum is going to stay hard pressed any positive reaction will reject “in front” of the DIR. Use a <span class="red">SELL DIR CR BREAKOUT</span> strategy to capture this outlook. A rise above the DIR R LEVEL at any time during the session however confirms a pause in the aggressive <span class="red">SELL</span>ing. Expectation is for the trade to turn digestive but there is the potential for a dramatic corrective rally. Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY R BREAKOUT</span> and <span class="blue bold">BUY UP BREAKOUT</span> strategies in conjunction to participate in a positive transition out of the lower extreme. The trade vision is for a 2 APMD move up to the UT2 (UPSIDE TARGET #2). Don’t press it. This is more likely a search for resistance to define a new trading range and follow through is unlikely in the coming sessions. 
       
       Note: The MKT is offered into the lower extreme and should continue to hold structure, which is defined by the DIR R LEVEL, if it is going to the downside. Beware of a corrective momentum shift where the MKT moves lower early in the session and then rallies all day.  Don't get turned around with any positive signal if the market cannot break structure. The underlying bias is negative and can get more extended before it exhausts. A breakout above the DIR R LEVEL does have the potential to produce a dramatic positive turn of events.`,

The best <span class="red">SELL R FADE</span> opportunities will happen prior to any previous decline in the trade period, typically early in the session.  The R LEVEL defines the structure high point for the negative momentum and a breach will signal the potential for a positive transition. Use a <span class="blue bold">BUY R BREAKOUT</span> strategy to participate in a positive shift in state and potential trend change. Work positive price structure as this signal can influence the MKT for the next few sessions if not weeks.  If the signal cannot maintain a trade above the CRX+ after a <span class="blue bold">BUY R BREAKOUT</span>, it is more likely to produce a choppy lower “churn” for the remainder of the session than a positive transition. 
       
       Note: This is an emotional and irrational trade state and not a day to get stubborn. The MKT is offered into the lower extreme and should continue to hold negative structure if it is going to release. Beware of a corrective momentum shift where the MKT moves lower from the start of the session and then rallies all day targeting the R LEVEL.`,

A <span class="blue bold">BUY DP REVERSAL</span> has more value than a <span class="blue bold">BUY R FADE</span> strategy. Both are valid especially early in the session however, a reversal signal will provide good confirmation of the corrective signal. The best opportunities will exhaust “in front” of the R LEVEL and provide only 1 shot to entry opportunity. Both strategies target the DIR. How the MKT reacts here will provide clarity to the true intentions of the corrective condition. If the MKT is going to fall back into a sideways corrective trade it will reject “in front” of the DIR. Use a <span class="red">SELL DIR CR BREAKOUT</span> to take advantage of a digestive expectation. A breach of the DIR is a positive signal however the trade is corrective and not expected to follow through. Use a <span class="red">SELL UP REVERSAL</span> strategy to capture a return of the negative momentum. Once the corrective emotion has run its course the Bears will be back for a bite and this strategy is a good indication that its dinner time. For any “corrective” trade to continue it will maintain a trade above the DIR once breached. A break back under the DIR is sign of weakness that targets the R LEVEL. Use a <span class="red">SELL DIR BREAKOUT</span> to capture this opportunity. This strategy works best early in the session. If later, tighten up profit objectives to the DP and expect a sideways trade to develop.

If the MKT builds negative structure below here it will start to “circle the drain” and should just “release” if it is indeed going to BREAKOUT. Expectation is for a steady price deterioration, any positive REVERSAL signal is a sign that the trade will turn digestive. A violation of the R LEVEL is expected to provide a “pop” of energy, with the potential to be the start of a new transition higher. Here too the rally should maintain positive structure as any exhaustive negative REVERSAL is a sign that the action is just an expansion of the current trading range parameters.`,
