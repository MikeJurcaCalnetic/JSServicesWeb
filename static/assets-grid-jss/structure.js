A sustained breach of UT1 or DT1 is a signal that the market is moving back into a trend position. How the market reacts off the CriticalRange extremes (UP and DP) is the key to the session action.

Look for REVERSAL signals off any resistance below this level. A held breach of the R LEVEL has the potential to transition the market into a NEUTRAL or a positive state. A “false” BREAKOUT or REVERSAL is potentially the top of the next move to new move lows. If the MKT trades under the DIR (DIRECTIONAL), it should remain below that price point if the BEAR TREND is going to engage. Work any negative structure as there is the potential for a multi session decline. If the MKT cannot maintain a trade below the DIR and instead trades back up through it, the expectation should be for a difficult sideways digestive trade with the R LEVEL the upper lid. This market structure bias is a sign of underlying weakness which can produce an emotional squeeze into a good selling opportunity near the R LEVEL.`,
